{"name":"Scorecard","body":"Scorecard is a jQuery plugin that lets you show off your [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com)'s completed and/or in-progress courses as well as earned badges.\r\n\r\n##Demo!\r\n\r\nSoon.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\n1. Clone/Download `jquery-scorecard.min.js` somewhere in your project.\r\n2. Include a recent version of jQuery and Scorecard in `<head>`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery-scorecard.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nScorecard will append an unordered list inside the specified element for each\r\nof the three sections (completed courses, in-progress courses and badges). For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"my-cs-badges\">\r\n  <h2>My Code School Bages</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n...\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n  $('#my-cs-badges).scorecard({\r\n    username: 'dmondark',\r\n    sections: ['badges'],\r\n    loading:\r\n      message: 'Loading Code School bages...'\r\n  });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n##Configuration\r\n\r\nA hash of options can be passed to scorecards as below:\r\n\r\n* `username`: Your code school username (This is required)\r\n* `sections`: An 1-3 elements array of the sections to be rendered possible\r\nvalues are: 'completed', 'in-progress' and/or 'badges' (default: All)\r\n* `newtab`: Whether clicking on a course/badge will open the link in a new tab\r\n(default: false)\r\n* `loading.message`: The text displayed while the badges are being loaded\r\n(default \"Loading...\")\r\n* `loading.id`: The ID assigned to the <p> element that wraps the loading message\r\n(default \"load-message\")\r\n\r\n##Styling\r\n\r\nScorecard tries to be non-intrusive and will not add any classes or ids to the\r\nmarkup it is generating. Element hierarchy can instead be used to style any of\r\nthe child elements if needs be.\r\nFor the example above, to set an opacity of .5 to the badges on hover, a sample\r\ncss selector would look something like:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#my-cs-badges > ul > li > a > img:hover{\r\n  opacity: 0.5;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Thanks\r\nMany thanks to the good guys at Code School for the help with the API.\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to Mihail Szabolcs ([@theicebreaker](https://twitter.com/theicebreaker))\r\nfor writing [Proudify](https://github.com/icebreaker/proudify) which was the main\r\ninspiration behind Scorecard.\r\n\r\nThis plugin was jump-started with Zeno Rocha's [jquery-boilerplate](https://github.com/zenorocha/jquery-boilerplate)\r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThis is my very first CoffeeScript project as well as my first jQuery plugin,\r\ntherefore there bound to be things that I'm doing wrong and/or obviously missing.\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea about a feature or a better and more obvious way to do\r\nsomething, please help by forking the repo, doing your magic and sending a pull\r\nrequest (using a feature branch would be superb). Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n##License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Ali B. (http://awhitebox.com)\r\n\r\nScorecards is provided under the MIT license.
